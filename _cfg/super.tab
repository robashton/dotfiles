    logfile=/var/log/super.log	# log to this file... \
    renewtime=y			# this says the user doesn't need to re-enter \
				# password if super cmds are issued frequently \
				# (so that we "know" it must be all one user) \
    # patterns=shell		# set user/group/host patterns matching to \
				# Bourne-shell style patterns \
				# (but note it's commented out). \
    # timestampuid=sysmgr	# create timestamp files w/ uid sysmgr \
				# (but note it's commented out). \
